# Phrases of power documentation

### Phrase alphabet

For ease of reference, the permitted characters in phrases of power are:

 * All alphanumeric characters (are the case sensitive???)
 * `'`, `!` and `.` (single quote, exclamation mark, and full stop)
 * the tab, line feed and carriage return characters.

In particular, `-` (hyphen) is *not* permitted.

### Known phrases

 * `Ei!`

### Candidate phrases

`Ia! Ia`
`R'lyeh`


#### Strings from competition artifacts 

 * `davar`
 * `Aleister`
 * `Why is there a watermelon there`

#### Strings from Lovecraft texts

These strings have been taken directly from [online versions of Lovecraft's writings](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/).  We should also try variations without trailing punctuation.

 * `Cthulhu fhtagn!` [<a href="#cc">1</a>]
 * `Ph'nglui Mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.` [<a href="#cc">1</a>]
   * This string has 51 characters, which is the length of the longest phrase of power.
 * Substrings of `Dia ad aghaidh ’s ad aodann . . . agus bas dunach ort!` (this string is longer than 51 characters) [<a href="#rw">2</a>]
   * Could also try with `...` instead of `. . .`

The following strings contain `-`, which is not a valid character in our language.  However, substrings might match.

 * `Yog-Sothoth` [<a href="#dh">3</a>]
 * `Shub-Niggurath!` [<a href="#dh">3</a>]
 * `N’gai, n’gha’ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y’hah` [<a href="#dh">3</a>]
